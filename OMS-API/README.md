*Perform operations related to product(s) stock.*

The main purpose of this module is to provide information regarding stock of product(s). The transformation rules for the module are defined in mappings/stock, and the typings for stock are available in types/stock.

> **Warning:**
For fetching the stock we are using *`checkInventory`* api that has a constraint of processing maximum 100 records at once, thus make sure to not exceed the viewSize by 100 and if needed, use pagination for the same.

**Use Cases:**
- fetch total stock for product(s) on all facilities
- fetch stock for product(s) on single/multiple/0(zero) facilities

Methods:
- fetchProductsStock
- fetchProductsStockAtFacility
